// Variables in JavaScript are containers for storing data values. They are declared using keywords like let, const, or var.

// Declaring variables
let name = "John"; // Using let for mutable variables
const PI = 3.14; // Using const for constants
var age = 30; // Using var (older approach)

// Reassigning values
name = "Jane"; // Variable 'name' reassigned

// Outputting variables
console.log("Name:", name); // Output: Name: Jane
console.log("PI:", PI); // Output: PI: 3.14
console.log("Age:", age); // Output: Age: 30

// Variables declared with let and var are mutable, meaning their values can be changed.

// Constants declared with const cannot be reassigned once initialized.

// Variables declared with var have function-level scope, which may lead to unintended behavior.

// Variables declared with let and const have block-level scope, which helps prevent unintended variable hoisting and leakage.

// JavaScript variable names are case-sensitive.

// Variable names can include letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs, but they cannot start with a digit.

// Reserved keywords cannot be used as variable names.
